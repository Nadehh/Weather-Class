# Weather-Class
A simple class to send a HTTP request to Open Weather Map and to process the information
This is in very early stages and is currently being tested for bugs, and will also become more efficient as the bugs are taken out.
This is also going to be used for my first discord bot to get weather updates

I will also implement more methods to retrieve further information about the weather
